# Orpheus ESP32

The Orpheus ESP32 is a small but powerful dev board based on the new ESP32-C6 chip. It’s perfect for all kinds of cool IoT projects since it supports Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth LE, Zigbee, and Thread — basically, it can talk to tons of smart devices.

## About the Project

This board was made by an awesome 13-year-old builder, with some help and funding from Hack Club. It’s a great example of how young people are already making big things in hardware.
