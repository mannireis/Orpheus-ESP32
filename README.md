# Orpheus ESP32

The Orpheus ESP32 is a small but powerful dev board based on the new ESP32-C6 chip. It’s perfect for all kinds of cool IoT projects since it supports Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth LE, Zigbee, and Thread — basically, it can talk to tons of smart devices.

## About the Project

This board was made by an awesome 13-year-old builder, with some help and funding from Hack Club. It’s a great example of how young people are already making big things in hardware.

## Main Stuff

- **Chip:** ESP32-C6 — a fast 32-bit processor  
- **Memory:** 8MB flash to store your code and data  
- **Wireless:** Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5 (LE), Zigbee 3.0, Thread  
- **Connections:** GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, ADC, DAC, PWM, timers, and a temp sensor built-in  
- **Power:** Low power usage, so it’s great for battery-powered projects  
- **USB-C:** For power, data, and uploading your programs  

## What Can You Make?

- Cool IoT gadgets using different wireless options  
- Smart home stuff like automation devices  
- Industrial sensors and control systems  
- Custom projects that need sensor data and wireless communication  

## How to Start

1. Install ESP-IDF by following Espressif’s official guide  
2. Plug the Orpheus ESP32 into your computer with USB-C  
3. Find the serial port your OS assigns  
4. Flash your firmware using ESP-IDF tools, PlatformIO, or Arduino IDE  

## Tools You’ll Use

- **PCB Design:** EasyEDA  
- **Coding:** ESP-IDF, PlatformIO, Arduino IDE  
- **Community:** It’s open-source and super friendly for makers
